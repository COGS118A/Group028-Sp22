    "Association Football (or soccer) is a worldwide sport played by over 250 million players in over 250 countries<sup><a name=\"note-assoc-football\" href=\"#assoc-football\">[1]</a></sup>.  In fact, football is the world’s sport, and the most popular across the globe in terms of fans as well. Football has a huge transfer market in which players are transferred across teams for up to hundreds of millions of euros. To put the amount of money that circulates in the global football market into perspective, squad values of top teams like Manchester United surpass billions of euros<sup><a name=\"note-transfermarkt-value-how\" href=\"#transfermarkt-value-how\">[2]</a></sup>. The market value of a player accounts for a huge role in how teams conduct their business in regards to transfers. Our goal is to help these clubs make the right investments in players they want to obtain, especially when spending huge amounts of money. More specifically, we want to accurately predict the market value of players so that clubs aren’t overpaying, or underselling their valued players. Plenty of factors play a role in determining the market value of a player. The most important factors include age, performance for club and national team (measured in stats such as goals, assists, tackles etc.) for a player in that position, experience(measured by number of seasons in top leagues), marketing value (measured by social media presence), and injury vulnerability<sup><a name=\"note-transfermarkt-value-how\" href=\"#transfermarkt-value-how\">[2]</a></sup>.

    "Fill in the background and discuss the kind of prior work that has gone on in this research area here. **Use inline citation** to specify which references support which statements.  You can do that through HTML footnotes (demonstrated here).

So use the method that works for you, but do use inline citations.\n",

    "The global football transfer market involves the circulation of billions of euros. Many top European clubs have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to bolster their respective teams. For example teams like Manchester United, Manchester City, and PSG have spent almost billions of euros to sign players to help their teams’ success in their respective leagues and on the European stage<sup><a name=\"note-man-utd\" href=\"#man-utd\">[6]</a></sup>. There is no doubt that decisions involving huge sums of such money should be carefully analyzed so that clubs can maximize success in both the business side as well as the performance side of their respective clubs. Transfermarkt is an online platform for transfers, market values, rumors, and stats. The business model consists of, in addition to sports journalistic reporting, the profiles of the players and discussion forums on the performance and market values of individual soccer players, teams and leagues<sup><a name=\"note-ackermann-follert-etal\" href=\"#ackermann-follert-etal\">[4]</a></sup>. Frequently being discussed in sports science and sports economics literature over the past few years, the so-called \"market values\" („Marktwerte“) have s to become the center of media attentioMultipleous studies have shown positive correlations between the predicted market values on Transfermarkt and the actual player income.’It’s reportedly known that players who are in contract negotiations would sometimes refer to Transfermarkt values as baselines for their salary expectations<sup><a name=\"note-ackermann-follert-etal\" href=\"#ackermann-follert-etal\">[4]</a></su>.  The “market values” can also be used as a measure of marketability; a higher marketability helps a player secure partnerships through sponsorship contracts. The age and performance statistics on Transfermarkt are also particularly useful in that player observers can identify young players and predict the development opportunities<sup><a name=\"note-ackermann-follert-etal\" href=\"#ackermann-follert-etal\">[4]</a></sup>. \n",
    "\n",
    "The open forums of Transfermarkt allow users to discuss and predict individual players’ market values and performance. Previous studies on collective intelligence<sup><a name=\"note-transfermarkt-value-how\" href=\"#transfermarkt-value-how\">[2]</a></sup> have used OLS regression models to evaluate the accuracy of predictions. It is shown that “forecasts of international soccer results based on the crowd’s valuations are more accurate than those based on standard predictors.”<sup><a name=\"note-peeters\" href=\"#peeters\">[3]</a></sup> This reveals a potential possibility that distributed intelligence is a contributing factor to the accuracy of predictions. We want to know if supervised machine learning algorithms, as another form of distributed intelligence, can make accurate predictions just as humans do. More particularly, we want to use machine learning models like OLS to predict market value of players across the football world. "

    "Given the considerable number of players in football across the globe, it can get tedious to know which players have potential and are worth investing in. Do they have high performance for a player in their position? Are they playing for a renowned club or in a renowned league? Is their behavior respectable and are they marketable? These are the kinds of questions top clubs use when considering paying the big bucks for players. The problem we are trying to tackle is predicting the market value of players (in euros) using stats that are important when investing in a player such as goals, assists, and marketability."

Think clearly about your results, decide on one main point and 2-4 secondary points you want us to understand. Highlight HOW your results support those points.  You probably want 2-5 sentences per point.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "Are there any problems with the work?  For instance would more data change the nature of the problem? Would it be good to explore more hyperparams than you had time for?   \n",
    "\n",
    "### Ethics & Privacy\n",
    "Since our data is readily available to the public and conforms to the privacy policy of the sourcing website Transfermarkt, we believe our research will not be subject to immediate concerns with neither ethics nor data privacy. Variables include `name`/`pretty_name` (name), `country_of_birth`/`country_of_citizenship` (nationality), `date_of_birth` (age) might be potentially relevant but are in no way detrimental to the ethics of our research. However, we do believe that the result of our research, once obtained and made public, could have unintended consequences. We evaluate a player's performance solely based on historical data; this implies that there will be biases. It is reasonable to expect that those biases, if not addressed and handled properly, could cause permanent damage to a person’s career. For instance, if a reliable player’s record shows that the player is unreliable, then team recruiters would use that information to make an informed decision based on false information. To prevent the chance of this being a consequence, we will put a disclaimer regarding the features that were not used in the evaluation of a player’s value. If a problem such as this comes up, we will remove said player's data from the study and make an effort to find and use the accurate data for each player. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "Reiterate your main point and in just a few sentences tell us how your results support it. Mention how this work would fit in the background/context of other work in this field if you can. Suggest directions for future work if you want to."
